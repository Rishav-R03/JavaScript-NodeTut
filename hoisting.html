    <p>A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern.
        The search pattern can be used for text search and text replace operations.</p>
    <p>Regular expressions can be used to perform all types of text search and text replace operations.</p>
    <p><strong>Syntax/pattern/modifiers;</strong></p>
    <p>In JavaScript, regular expressions are often used with the two string methods: search() and replace().
        The search() method uses an expression to search for a match, and returns the position of the match.
        The replace() method returns a modified string where the pattern is replaced.</p>
    <p>Meaning: The block of code is aware of the variable, but it cannot be used until it has been declared.

        Using a let variable before it is declared will result in a ReferenceError.

        The variable is in a "temporal dead zone" from the start of the block until it is declared:</p>
    <p>JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initializations.</p>
